## Hi, I am Emirhan Koç 👋

- ⚡I have recently completed my master's studies at Bilkent University, and pursuing my doctoral studies at the same university.

- 🔭 I’m currently working at the intersection of deep learning and computational biology, particularly in transcriptomics studies. Recently, I have completed a project that explore the utilization of LLMs and GNNs in cell type annotation task with scRNA-seq data.

- 🌱 Nowadays, I am learning more on biology, genomics and novel LLM-based models specifically designed for tasks based on scRNA-seq data analysis.

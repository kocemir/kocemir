## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the intersection of deep learning and computational biology, particularly in transcriptomics studies. Recently, I have completed a project that explore the utilization of LLMs and GNNs in cell type annotation task with scRNA-seq data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on biology, genomics and novel LLM-based models specifically designed for tasks based on scRNA-seq data analysis.

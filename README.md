## Hi, I am Emirhan KoÃ§ ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡I have recently completed my master's at Bilkent University, and pursuing my doctoral studies at the same university.
  
-  :monocle_face: During the M.Sc., I have worked mainly at the intersection of signal processing and deep learning. I have integrated the fractional Fourier transformer into various neural network architectures including sequence models and CNN in time series prediction and image processing tasks. But, my works are not limited to those. I have also worked on a time series imputation project which ended with a highly cited journal paper publication. Finally, I have worked on an NLP project that applies deep learning models to a classical linguistic concept. For more information, you can reach me or check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eUaNFf0AAAAJ&hl=en) account out.  
-     - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the intersection of deep learning and computational biology, particularly in transcriptomics studies. Recently, I have completed my first project that explores the utilization of LLMs and GNNs in cell type annotation task with scRNA-seq data. The work is submitted to a prestigious journal, IEEE TSIPN, is still under review. I am aheading to work on more of the similar projects. 

- ðŸŒ± Nowadays, I am learning more on biology, genomics and novel LLM-based models specifically designed for tasks based on scRNA-seq data analysis.
